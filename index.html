  <h2>CAS on Praying to Saints</h2>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
Starting off , James 5:16 says
“Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.”
This verse tells us to confess sins to one another and pray for them as a strong prayer can help a righteous man. We know from 2 Corinthians 5:21, 1 John
    3:2-3 and Hebrews 12:23 that the most righteous people are us when we are in heaven stated clearly in scripture. Another point is that nothing not saved
    from sin or unclean shall enter the kingdom of heaven mentioned in Revelation 21:27. John 9:31 tells us God will not hear of sinners ( who don’t follow
    Gods law of repentance ). And 1 John 5:16 asks us to intercede for those who sin but don’t reject God. But it is said only if they commit sins that do 
    not lead to eternal damnation . In 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 and many other pieces of scripture it tells us what sins lead to eternal damnation if left
    unrepented of.
