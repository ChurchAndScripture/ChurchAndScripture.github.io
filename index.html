<h1 style="color: darkblue;">Church And Scripture</h1>
  <h2 id="saints">CAS on Praying to Saints</h2>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
Starting off, James 5:16 says
“Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.”
This verse tells us to confess sins to one another and pray for them as a strong prayer can help a righteous man. We know from 2 Corinthians 5:21, 1 John
    3:2-3 and Hebrews 12:23 that the most righteous people are us when we are in heaven stated clearly in scripture. Another point is that nothing not saved
    from sin or unclean shall enter the kingdom of heaven mentioned in Revelation 21:27. John 9:31 tells us God will not hear of sinners (who don’t follow
    Gods law of repentance). And 1 John 5:16 asks us to intercede for those who sin but don’t reject God. But it is said only if they commit sins that do 
    not lead to eternal damnation . In 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 and many other pieces of scripture it tells us what sins lead to eternal damnation if left
    unrepented of. So with this, if saints are alive in heaven, they are praying for us. As 1 Timothy 2:1 states to pray for your brothers and sisters
    and the most righteous people (those who are in heaven) follow scripture to the letter. Luke 20:37-38 shows saints are alive with God as it is said, "For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him." Now at the 
    end of these verses it says all live, not just Abraham, Isaac and so on. A really important piece of scripture for Eastern Orthodoxy really helps us acknowledge
    praying to/asking saints. It really focuses on the early, true understanding of the first language Bible. Finally, ending this chapter, Romans 8:38-39 are the
    verses that explain the Church is one on Earth and in Heaven as it states in simpler words, death does not divide the body of Christ, instead it is united 
    through Christ not place. This is called the Communion of Saints.

  <h2 id="protestantism">CAS on Protestantism </h2>

<p style="line-height: 1.6;">
There are many different views on Protestantism and many sects in this denomination that differ in theology, worship and practice. However, they all believe in
  the 5 Solas, authority of the Holy Bible and generally the 2 sacraments. Starting with the 5 Solas, they are the principles originating around the 16th century
  reformation when Protestantism stands on. They include of Sola Scriptura, Sola Fide, Sola Gratia, Solus Christus and Soli Deo Gloria. The claim from Protestants
  is the Bible alone is the ultimate authority for faith and practice which of course is the idea of Sola Scriptura. Now the way CAS and/or Eastern Orthodoxy
  understands it is that the Bible is part of Holy Tradition, not separate from it. The reason Eastern Orthodoxy claims this is simple. But first, we need to go
  back to the first century where in Matthew 16:18, Jesus Christ founds the Church and adopts Saint Peter as the leader of it. Through the Church, books were
  created, the same books that were added to the Bible at around 400 AD. But do not get mistaken here as all of the books from both the Old Testament and
  the New 	Testament were finished by approximately 100 AD. So using this proof, the Church produced the Bible not the other way around. Scripture and 
  tradition are inseparable with both originating at the same time, which is after the founding of the Church by Jesus Christ. An easier way to depict it is as 
  saying, " We worship not the Bible but the living Word whom the Bible reveals." Moving on, we are met by Sola Fide, which claims we are justified by faith
  alone, apart from work. What Eastern Orthodoxy believes is that faith is of course necessary but must be expressed making it a living faith. We should express
  through love, repentance, obedience and many more works. So overall, Sola Fide is a heretical statement that we should not follow as without works, faith
  cannot be shown truly. Salvation is all by God's grace and human effort contributes nothing is what Sola Gratia is understood as. But the response from Eastern
  Orthodoxy is slightly different this time as we fully agree that salvation is impossible without grace. Although, we differ at the opinion that states human 
  free will or human effort effects no grace. Instead, our idea is that we have to cooperate with divine grace because of Synergy which simply means working 
  together. So while we do agree with part of Sola Gratia, we believe we must respond to God's sacrifice with us making the decision of accepting his word or not.
  Solus Christus is next and it represents the opinion that Christ alone is our mediator and no saints, priests, or even the most holy Theotokos Mary are needed. Now
  the main idea of Solus Christus tells us that to get to God, Christ is the only one who can deliver us there. But us Orthodox Christians see it as saints, priests and so
  on participate with the mediation of Christ in unity with him. In mediation, there is also intercession which can get mixed up but have 2 different meanings.
  When we say mediation through Christ our lord, we mean it as Christ taking us to God through the word, but intercession is praying for one another to reach 
  Christ through the word. Asking saints for intercession isn't ignoring Jesus however it can be looked at as going to the Church, the same Church Christ gave us.
  You might say God gave us the word as well, but asking saints to intercede for you before the Lord is just another step to reach God. Last but not least of the 5
  Solas we have Soli Deo Gloria. This Sola holds the meaning that all glory belongs to God alone, not anyone except Christ. Now this Sola can easily be found 
  heretical by many Orthodox Christians, but if you look at it with the right meanings, us Orthodox Christians actually do accept this Sola. Now we absolutely 
  agree that all glory
  belongs to God, but Protestantism sees the word glory in a different way. Eastern Orthodoxy sees veneration and adoration as 2 separate things. Veneration means 
  honour and as Angel Gabriel gave his respect to Mary, we do the same to those holy. But adoration on the other hand means worship and without debate only goes 
  to God. We see saints as reflections of Christ's glory yet nothing compares to it. That is why we differ the meanings as they can get easily mixed up and 
  accidently lead you into heretical beliefs. We have now finished with the 5 Solas and the authority of the Bible so that leaves the sacraments. In Eastern 
  Orthodoxy we have 7 sacraments or 7 "Holy Mysteries" being Baptism, Chrismation, Eucharist, Confession, Marriage, Holy Orders and Anointing of the Sick. It is 
  widely taught that the whole life in the Church is sacramental but the 7 are commonly spoken of. Protestants say only Baptism and Communion were explicitly 
  instituted by Christ in scripture. However, from the Gospels to Acts it states every sacrament from Confession to Marriage. Another point is that us Orthodox
  Christians reject limiting grace to only 2 sacraments as salvation thrives and lives through the life of the Church and not just in scripture.

<h2 id="councils">CAS on Church Councils</h2>

<h3 id="first-council-of-nicaea">First Council of Nicaea</h3>
  
  <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
Let's address the big question first, what exactly is a Church Council? Well a Church Council is a formal meeting of main church leaders or bishops discussing 
    arising problems or questions of faith that need to be answered. The first council (regional) occurred in 49 AD but the first ecumenical council happened
    in 325 AD. The last official ecumenical council was in 787 AD however Eastern Orthodoxy believes that any more councils can be approved if they are guided 
    by the Holy Spirit. Now the first one in 325 AD was The Council of Nicaea and it was called by Emperor Constantine the Great to discuss the issue about the
    nature of Christ. Before we look at the impact of this council, lets dive into why it was arranged. Firstly, Christians were persecuted throughout the
    Roman Empire until 313 AD when Constantine the Great issued the Edict of Milan which granted the freedom of religion to Christians. This allowed the Church
    to gather openly for the first time in history. This move lead to many great things but upon the victory a priest from Alexandria named Arius taught heretical
    and concerning ideas about Christ. It included of statements that said Jesus was created by the Father, he was not eternal and was only a divine-like being 
    but not God. The teachings of Arianism spread fast but it was slowly corrupting the Christian idea of salvation which was a key part of the Church. There are
    many problems about it but the main was that God became man to save us and if Jesus was not God, Christianity as a whole collapses into heresy. So this meant 
    for of course The First Council of Nicaea and around 318 bishops were invited to settle the dispute. Among them on the Christian side were figures like Saint
    Alexander and Saint Athanasius but leading Arianism included Eusebius of Caesarea and Eusebius of Nicomedia. In the Council, the Christian/Orthodox response 
    to the argument is that Jesus the Son is eternally begotten meaning he shares the same essence as the Father. Finally, the council ended with the bishops 
    condemning Arianism as heretical and creating the Nicene Creed we know today.
