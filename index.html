  <h2>CAS on Praying to Saints</h2>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
Starting off , James 5:16 says
“Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.”
This verse tells us to confess sins to one another and pray for them as a strong prayer can help a righteous man. We know from 2 Corinthians 5:21, 1 John
    3:2-3 and Hebrews 12:23 that the most righteous people are us when we are in heaven stated clearly in scripture. Another point is that nothing not saved
    from sin or unclean shall enter the kingdom of heaven mentioned in Revelation 21:27. John 9:31 tells us God will not hear of sinners ( who don’t follow
    Gods law of repentance ). And 1 John 5:16 asks us to intercede for those who sin but don’t reject God. But it is said only if they commit sins that do 
    not lead to eternal damnation . In 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 and many other pieces of scripture it tells us what sins lead to eternal damnation if left
    unrepented of. So with this, if saints are alive in heaven, they are praying for us. As 1 Timothy 2:1 states to pray for your brothers and sisters
    and the most righteous people (those who are in heaven) follow scripture to the letter.
Now, Luke 20:37-38 shows saints are alive with God as it is said, "For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him." Now at the 
    end of these verses it says all live, not just Abraham, Isaac and so on. A really important piece of scripture for Eastern Orthodoxy really helps us acknowledge
    praying to/asking saints. It really focuses on the early, true understanding of the first language Bible. Finally, ending this chapter, Romans 8:38-39 are the
    verses that explain the Church is one on Earth and in Heaven as it states in simpler words, death does not divide the body of Christ, instead it is united 
    through Christ not place. This is called the Communion of Saints.

  <h2> CAS on Protestantism </h2>

<p style="line-height: 1.6;">
There are many different views on Protestantism and many sects in this denomination that differ in theology, worship and practice. However, they all believe in
  the 5 Solas, authority of the Holy Bible and generally the 2 sacraments. Starting with the 5 Solas, they are the principles originating around the 16th century
  reformation when Protestantism stands on. They include of Sola Scriptura, Sola Fide, Sola Gratia, Solus Christus and Soli Deo Gloria. The claim from Protestants
  is the Bible alone is the ultimate authority for faith and practice which of course is the idea of Sola Scriptura. Now the way CAS and/or Eastern Orthodoxy
  understands it is that the Bible is part of Holy Tradition, not separate from it. The reason Eastern Orthodoxy claims this is simple. But first, we need to go
  back to the first century where in Matthew 16:18, Jesus Christ founds the Church and adopts Saint Peter as the leader of it. Through the Church, books were
  created, the same books that would be added to the Bible at around 400 AD. But do not get mistaken here as all of the books from both the Old Testament and
  the New 	Testament were finished by approximately 100 AD. So using this proof, the Church produced the Bible not the other way around. Scripture and 
  tradition are inseparable with both originating at the same time, which is after the founding of the Church by Jesus Christ. An easier way to depict it is as 
  saying, " We worship not the Bible but the living Word whom the Bible reveals." Moving on, we are met by Sola Fide, which claims we are justified by faith
  alone, apart from work. What Eastern Orthodoxy believes is that faith is of course necessary but must be expressed making it a living faith. We should express
  through love, repentance, obedience and many more works. So overall, Sola Fide is a heretical statement that we should not follow as without works, faith
  cannot be shown truly. Salvation is all by God's grace and human effort contributes nothing is what Sola Gratia is understood as. But the response from Eastern
  Orthodoxy is slightly different this time as we fully agree that salvation is impossible without grace. Although, we differ at the opinion that states human 
  free will or human effort effects no grace. Instead, our idea is that we have to cooperate with divine grace because of Synergy which simply means working 
  together. So while we do agree with part of Sola Gratia, we believe we must respond to God's sacrifice with us making the decision of accepting his word or not.
